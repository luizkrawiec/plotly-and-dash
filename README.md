# Overview of Plotly for Data Visualization and the Dash Framework

Recently, during my Python studies, I had the chance to explore the Plotly data visualization library. I found it to be a highly robust and versatile tool.

Plotly includes essential charts used daily by analysts and data scientists, such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie and donut charts, histograms, box plots, violin plots, and more.

From an aesthetic perspective, I noticed that the charts are visually appealing and offer extensive customization options.

Another feature that caught my attention is the ability to create interactive dashboards using the Dash framework, which can be easily shared and deployed. Dash is a Python-based framework with a simple and declarative interface that allows for easy creation of applications using components styled similarly to HTML and CSS. It integrates seamlessly with Plotly, enabling the quick and easy creation of interactive charts and their incorporation into applications.

Dash also supports real-time data, allowing continuous updates of visualizations, making it ideal for applications that require constant data refresh.

In everyday use, Plotly and Dash are excellent for visualizing KPIs and financial metrics. In data analysis, they allow for the creation of interactive tools to explore datasets and build applications that interact with machine learning models, visualizing results in a data science-oriented manner.

However, there are some limitations. Both Plotly and Dash can have performance issues and may not be suitable for very large applications or those requiring extremely high performance. For highly specific frontend functionalities, integrating or using custom React components might be necessary.

Below, you'll find some images showcasing the final dashboard.

Additionally, I will provide the .ipynb file for those who wish to use and explore the code themselves.
